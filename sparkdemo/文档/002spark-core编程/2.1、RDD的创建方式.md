##创建RDD

Resilient Distributed Datasets (RDDs)：
弹性分布式数据集
RDD支持容错和并行

###创建RDD有两种方式：
* 集合
* 外部存储系统：本地，任何支持Hadoop InputFormat格式的文件
```html
Spark revolves around the concept of a resilient distributed dataset (RDD), 
which is a fault-tolerant collection of elements that can be operated on in parallel. 
There are two ways to create RDDs: parallelizing an existing collection in your driver program, 
or referencing a dataset in an external storage system, such as a shared filesystem, HDFS, HBase, or any data source offering a Hadoop InputFormat.
```

## 集合方式
在driver中，使用SparkContext’s parallelize方法创建并行集合（Parallelized collections）
```html
Parallelized collections are created by calling SparkContext’s parallelize method on an existing collection in your driver program (a Scala Seq).
The elements of the collection are copied to form a distributed dataset that can be operated on in parallel.
For example, here is how to create a parallelized collection holding the numbers 1 to 5:
```
代码
```scala
val data = Array(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
val distData = sc.parallelize(data)
```
设置平行度

```html
Once created, the distributed dataset (distData) can be operated on in parallel.
For example, we might call distData.reduce((a, b) => a + b) to add up the elements of the array. We describe operations on distributed datasets later on.
One important parameter for parallel collections is the number of partitions to cut the dataset into. 
Spark will run one task for each partition of the cluster. 
Typically you want 2-4 partitions for each CPU in your cluster. 
Normally, Spark tries to set the number of partitions automatically based on your cluster. 
However, you can also set it manually by passing it as a second parameter to parallelize (e.g. sc.parallelize(data, 10)). 
Note: some places in the code use the term slices (a synonym for partitions) to maintain backward compatibility.
